### Frameshift substitutions and the shiftability of the genetic code and the protein coding genes

#### 1	Protein and coding DNA sequences 

All available reference CDSs in model organisms were retrieved from the UCSC Genome Database. 

Ten thousand simulated CDSs (each with 500 sense codons) were generated by Recodon 1.6.0. 

#### 2	Aligning and computing the similarity of the wild-type and frameshifts

Program Frameshift-Align.java is used to batch translate all coding sequences in their three different reading frames, align the three translations, and compute their pairwise similarities. Each internal nonsense codon was translated into an amino acid according to the readthrough rules (Table 1). The details are described in the supplementary text.

#### 3 Computational analysis of frameshift codon substitutions

Program Frameshift-CODON.java is used to compute the average substitution scores for each kind of codon substitution by using a scoring matrix, BLOSSUM62, PAM250, or GON250. 

#### 4	Computational analysis of alternative codon tables

Program RandomCodes.java is used to produce random codon tables.

Program AlternativeCodes.java is used to produce alternative codon tables.

The sum of FSSs for each of the random or compatible genetic codes was computed and sorted ascendingly and compared with that of the natural genetic code. 

####5	Computational analysis of the usage of codon and codon pairs and their frameshift substitution scores

Program CodonUsage.java and CODONPAIR.java was used to compute the usages of codons and codon pairs for the genomes, and their average amino acid substitution scores. 

The codons/dicodons whose observed value is greater/smaller than their expected value were identified as over-/under-represented, and their weighted average FSSs were calculated for each genome.

The result of these calculations is a list of 4096 codon pairs with their corresponding FSSs, which is used to evaluate the frameshift tolerability of the codon pairs presented in a genome.
